She has dark brown hair in pigtails, and is wearing pink heart-shaped sunglasses, a leather motorcycle jacket, a pink skirt, fishnet stockings and black combat boots. She is smiling, despite the bee situation.">

      <p class="updates-section">3/7/2024 - I made this tribute page for my studies at <a href="freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp.org</a>, but I decided to actually use it and maintain it! I've been a big Animal Crossing fan since Wild World on the DS, but I've recently gotten back into New Horizons. I'm going to make a page for all of my villagers eventually, but right now only Ione's is up. Stay tuned for the rest!</p>
