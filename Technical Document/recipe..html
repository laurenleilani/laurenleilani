           I love making this easy meal at least once a week! I make a big batch so my partner and I can have at least 2-3 meals each out of it.
          </p>
Primarily, I like it because of 3 main reasons:
          <p>
         
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It's Vegan - I'm not a strict vegan since I sometimes eat eggs, but I avoid meat and dairy. 
            </li>
            <li>
           Easy & Quick - Great for nights where I'm not in the mood to do too much cooking because it's just a matter of prepping the broccoli, boiling the pasta, throwing stuff in a blender and then mixing it all up.
            </li>
             <li>
          Filling & Nutritious - The cashews are a great source of protein and healthy fats while the broccoli and pumpkin provide vitamins and fiber. 
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Here's what ya need:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
     2-3 large heads of broccoli, cut into medium florets
  <li>Olive oil, for drizzling </li>
  <li>Salt, to taste
  <li>Cracked black pepper, to taste
  <li>2 boxes of fusilli or small shell pasta
  <li>2 cups raw cashews
  <li>Hot water, as needed
  <li>1 can (about 15 oz) pumpkin puree
  <li>1.5 cups nutritional yeast
  <li>2 tablespoons grain mustard, divided
  <li>Vegan butter or olive oil, for pasta
  <li>A few splashes of unsweetened soy milk (I think almond milk would work fine too!)
          </ul>

          You'll need some equipment:
          </p>
          <ul>
       <li>Baking Sheets: for roasting the broccoli, sometimes I find I need two of them - you don't wanna overcrowd the broccoli!</li>

<li>Parchment Paper: so the broccoli doesn't stick to the pans and is easier to clean up.</li>

<li>Big Pot: 2 boxes usually is the max my largest pot can handle.</li>

<li>Colander: To drain the pasta.</li>

<li>Blender: For blending the cashews, pumpkin puree, nutritional yeast, and seasonings into a sauce! </li>

<li>Measuring Cups and Spoons: I usually loosely measure this stuff but they can come in handy if you're not sure!</li>

<li>Mixing Spoon: To stir and combine the pasta with the sauce and roasted broccoli. I like a good ol wooden spoon.</li>

<li>Knife: 4 choppin' broccoli.</li>

<li>Cutting Board: For safely + cleanly choppin' broccoli.</li>

<li>Oven Mitts: Don't burn yourself getting the broccoli outta the oven!</li>
</ul>

         Time to make this stuff!
         </p>
         <ol>
         
           <li><code>Preheat the oven to 420°F (215°C):</code>  Line the baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
          <br>
 <li><code>Prepare the Broccoli:</code>  Cut up and place the broccoli florets on the baking sheets. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and cracked black pepper. Toss 'em around to coat evenly. (Sometimes I throw all the broccoli in a bowl and really drench them with the olive oil but if that's too much oil for your tastes, drizzling them with a little over the pan is fine too! I'm just an olive oil freak.)</li>
<br>
 <li><code>Roast the Broccoli:</code>  Bake in the oven for about 20ish minutes, or until the florets are crispy and starting to brown. Remove from the oven and set aside.</li>
<br>
 <li><code>Cook the Pasta:</code>  While the broccoli is roasting, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and return to the pot.</li>
<br>
 <li><code>Make the Pumpkin Cheese Sauce:</code>  In a blender, combine the raw cashews with just enough hot water to cover them. Add the pumpkin puree, nutritional yeast, a pinch of salt, black pepper, and one tablespoon of grain mustard. Blend until smooth. (If it seems to thick, add a little more hot water. If it's too thin, add more cashews + nutritional yeast!)</li>
<br>
 <li><code>Combine:</code>  Add a little vegan butter or olive oil to the drained pasta along with a few splashes of soy milk and the prepared pumpkin cheese sauce. Stir until the pasta is evenly coated.</li>
<br>
 <li><code>Finally:</code>  Add in the remaining tablespoon of grain mustard and the roasted broccoli until everything is well combined.</li>
<br>
 <li><code>Serve:</code>  Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary and serve warm!</li>

      <p>Enjoy this meal as is or with a side salad for a complete meal.
      <p>I love Tajin seasoning sprinkled on at the end, it give it a nice bright flavor. 
      <p>I also tried using lemon-infused olive oil on the broccoli before and it was amazing!
      <p>Store the leftovers in an airtight container and enjoy within 2-3 days.
      <p>I haven't tried it, but I'm sure this could be made gluten-free with your favorite gluten-free pasta!
      <p>Another thing I haven't tried, but I think if you were allergic to cashews, you could try a nut-free vegan cheese. This <a href="https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-cheese-sauce/">recipe</a> from Nora Cooks looks good!
      <p> I also have to give credit to Minimalist Baker as this sauce is inspired from how many times I've made her <a href="https://minimalistbaker.com/5-minute-vegan-cashew-queso/">5-Minute Vegan Cashew Queso</a>! Also, I bet that would taste super good on pasta too. Hmm...
