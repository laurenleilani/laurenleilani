ðŸŒ· Hello, I'm Lauren Leilani Iona aka moonpr1sm! ðŸŒ· 

I'm an artist and aspiring web developer. I got into making websites in 2023 after discovering Neocities & the Web Revival scene.
I love the spirit of the early Internet, when things felt more personal and creative. I'm into retro aesthetics but really love the
challenge of trying to blend that with modern practices for efficiency & accessibility reasons.

ðŸŒ» updated 3/17/2024 ðŸŒ»

I made it my goal in 2024 to try and learn as much as I can about web development 
and computer science through studying free online resources. So far, I love it!! I have a lot to learn still,
but I'm eager to keep going. I'm starting a course on Javascript through freecodecamp this week.
Wanna see what I've been working on?
